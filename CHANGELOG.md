Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

0.30.4 — 2025-09-04
- Changed: Git repos initialize on `main` (no more `master` hints); falls back to branch rename when needed.
- Changed: Cleaner output — suppresses git and package manager noise so steps show as concise checklists.
- Changed: Global MCP install runs quietly; keeps scaffold output tidy.

  create → valet → app.

- Added: Git initialization enabled by default with `--no-git` opt-out.
